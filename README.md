# Recognition of human activities

A current engineering challenge is to identify human activity (e.g., walking, in car, on bike, eating,
smoking, falling) from smartphones and other wearable devices. More specifically, the embedded
sensors (e.g., accelerometers and gyroscopes) produce a time series of position, velocity, and
acceleration measurements. These time series are then processed to produce a set of features that
can be used for activity recognition. The aim of this topic is to develop a supervised method to
classify observations into human activities categories.
